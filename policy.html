                                        <h2>COOKIE POLICY</h2><h6>As of September 10, 2015</h6>
                                        <p>IMPORTANT NOTICE: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE: This policy explains how cookies are used on this website. The policy may be amended from time to time. When we do, we will let you know by appropriate means such as by posting the revised policy on this page with a new “Last Updated” date. By using this site you agree to the placement of cookies on your computer in accordance with the terms of this policy. If you do not wish to accept cookies from this site please either disable cookies or refrain from using this site.</p>
                                        <h6>1. What are Cookies?</h6>
                                        <p>A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer’s hard disk so that the website can recognize you when you revisit and remember certain information about you. This can include which pages you have visited, choices you have made from menus, any specific information you have entered into forms and the time and date of your visit.</p>
                                        <h6>2 Types of Cookies</h6>
                                        <p>There are two main types of cookies:</p>
                                        <p>Session cookies: these are temporary cookies that expire at the end of a browser session; that is, when you leave the site. Session cookies allow the website to recognize you as you navigate between pages during a single browser session and allow you to use the website most efficiently. For example, session cookies enable a website to remember that a user has placed items in an online shopping basket.</p>
                                        <p>Persistent cookies: in contrast to session cookies, persistent cookies are stored on your equipment between browsing sessions until expiry or deletion. They therefore enable the website to “recognize” you on your return, remember your preferences, and tailor services to you.</p>
                                        <p>In addition to session cookies and persistent cookies, there may be other cookies which are set by the website which you have chosen to visit, such as this website, in order to provide us or third parties with information.</p>
                                        <h6>3 Our use of Cookies</h6>
                                        <p>We currently use, and may use in the future, the following types of cookies on this website.</p>
                                        <p>We use session cookies to:</p>
                                        <p>help us maintain security and verify your details whilst you use the website as you navigate from page to page, which enables you to avoid having to re-enter your details each time you enter a new page.</p>
                                        <p>We use persistent cookies to:</p>
                                        <p>help us recognize you as a unique user when you return to our website so that you do not have to input your details multiple times as you move between our pages or services</p>
                                        <p>remember how you have customized your use of this site, such as your preferred currency and time zone

</p>
                                        <p>collect and compile anonymous, aggregated information for statistical and evaluation purposes to help us understand how users use the website and help us improve the structure of our website.

</p>
                                        <p>Many cookies are designed to give you optimal usage of the web. For example, we use cookies to enable you to improve your user experience when using our website, e.g. a cookie which recognizes if your browser supports specific technology features. This helps, for example, in enabling web pages to be loaded more quickly when you request the download of a large file.

</p>
                                        <p>In addition to cookies which send information to us, we also use cookies which collect information and send it to third parties. An example of this is Google Analytics. We use Google Analytics to help collect and compile information like the number of visitors to the site, where visitors have come to the site from and the pages they visited. Visit Google’s site for an overview of privacy at Google and information on how to opt out of the Google Analytics cookie. Where this site allows such cookies to be set or you access other websites from this site using the links provided, the operators of these websites will use cookies in accordance with their own cookies policy, which may differ from ours.</p>
                                        <p>As with first party cookies, you are able to block third party cookies through your browser settings.

</p>
                                        <p>Some of our cookies may collect and store your personal information, such as your name or email address. We are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy and will ensure that all personal information collected by us is kept and treated in accordance with our privacy policy. A link to this policy is available within the footer of this portal or alternatively at our Bestkryptfieldd-assets.com website.
